# i1 Data Encoder

### This is the all-locally hosted version of the encoder. Please make issues/pull requests if anything is not working. We want people to contribute and be open with their creations to the i1, and by contributing to this project, you can help with that.

This encoder was made by Dalk with help from April (mewtek).

Included are both a nodejs and python3 version, made to run on any device on the same network as I1.

**The python version is the ONLY one that has locally hosted data processing.**

This uses SSH to communicate with the i1 to send/receive data.

Please feel free to make pull requests/issues.
