# i1 Data Encoder

### The python version uses a local server, which is recommended as the nodeJS version uses a backend that hasn't been updated with latest fixes. also, update coming soon with quite a few new features! stay tuned!

This encoder was made by Dalk with help from April (mewtek) and WxChaser.

Included are both a nodejs and python3 version, made to run on any device on the same network as I1.

**The python version is the ONLY one that has locally hosted data processing.**

This uses SSH to communicate with the i1 to send/receive data.
